# Pendulum
Pendulum is a wireless hydrometer powered by the ESP-8266 which fits through the ~30mm neck on a glass carboy. In progress.

Development updates can be found at the project's [github pages site](https://jslater89.github.io/pendulum).

## Patent Trouble!
The source code here as of today infringes on a US patent owned by the Tilt hydrometer guys (at tilthydrometer.com), so don't use it. We're working on some alternative ideas which don't infringe. There's more at the github pages site/blog.
